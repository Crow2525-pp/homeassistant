    \ - **Appliance Trigger:**\n      - Enter the power sensor entity that measures
    the live current draw of the appliance. Common devices with these sensors include
    smart plugs, energy meters, etc.\n      - The automation is triggered when the
    appliance's current draw exceeds a set wattage.\n      - The automation ends when
    the appliance's current draw falls below a set value.\n\n  - **Notification Options:**\n
    \     - Send notification messages to one or multiple devices when the appliance
    starts, finishes or the watchdog is triggered.\n      - Your end message can also
    include estimates of total power consumption and cost.\n      - Include duration
    tracking in your end message to track the appliance's operational time for the
    task or cycle.\n      - Opt to sends a repeated notifications to remind you when
    the appliance cycle is complete.\n      - Limit when notifications can be sent
    by using Notify Time Restrictions - helpful for avoiding alerts while you're asleep.\n
    \     - Notifications are compatible with both Apple iOS and Android devices,
    ensuring universal accessibility.\n\n  - **Energy Tracking:**\n      - Use energy
    tracking to estimate the total energy usage (kWh) for each completed cycle. You
    can also choose to include the estimated cost of that cycle in the end notification.\n
    \     - Or simply update the start and end helpers without including any energy
    information in the end notification - useful for your own custom actions or other
    Home Assistant logic.\n      \n      ⚠️ **Disclaimer** - These values are estimates
    and should only be used as a guide. Please avoid relying solely on these estimates
    for accuracy and use them at your own risk. We cannot be held responsible for
    any inaccuracies or resulting losses, damages, inconvenience, or anything else
    that may occur.\n\n  - **Time Tracking:**\n      - Runtime Tracking - Records
    the total runtime of your appliance by updating a text helper each time it completes
    a full cycle.\n      - Duration Tracking - Tracks how long the appliance was running
    during each individual cycle and includes this duration in the end notification
    message.\n\n  - **Cycle Counter:**\n      - Use the cycle counter to track the
    total number of cycles completed by your appliance. You can also choose to include
    this information in your end message.\n\n  - **Service Reminders:**\n      - Service
    reminders help you track appliance usage and perform timely maintenance.\n      -
    Cycle-Based Reminder - Notifies you when a service is due based on the number
    of cycles completed.\n      - Time-Based Reminder - Notifies you when a service
    is due based on the total time the appliance has been in use since the last service.\n\n
    \ - **Watchdog:**\n      - The watchdog option monitors an appliance cycle completion.\n
    \     - It sends a notification if a cycle completion fails within the specified
    time frame.\n\n  - **Custom Actions:**\n      - Tailor custom actions to suit
    your preferences and needs, enhancing the automation's functionality.\n      -
    Configure actions such as triggering announcements on platforms like The Voice
    (HA), Google, Alexa, etc., to keep you informed about appliance events.\n\n  -
    **Custom Conditions:**\n      - Enter any custom conditions to further customize
    the automation process.\n</details>\n\nNeed help? \n- FAQ: [Click Here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/650166/2)\n-
