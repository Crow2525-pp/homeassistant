# DAILY BACKUP AUTOMATION - TEMPLATE (DISABLED)
# ============================================================================
# This file is a TEMPLATE ONLY and should NOT be used.
#
# Use "automations/10_system_daily_backup.yaml" instead, which contains
# the active, working daily backup automation.
#
# This template is kept for reference only.
# ============================================================================

# To enable daily backups, use automations/10_system_daily_backup.yaml
# The active automation uses the CORRECT service: hassio.backup_full
# which works across all Home Assistant versions.

# DO NOT USE THIS TEMPLATE - IT MAY CAUSE CONFIGURATION ERRORS.
# See docs/BACKUP_AUTOMATION_FIXES.md for more information.
